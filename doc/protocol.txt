uint32 seq_number // packet number
uint32 seq_total // all packet numbers
uint8 type // type packet: 0 == ACK, 1 == PUT
byte id[8] // 8 байт - file id
byte data[data_size] // after the header and up to the end of the UDP packet there is data

The maximum size of a UDP packet is 1472 bytes.

PUT: the type is set when sending data from the client to the server
seq_number is set equal to the number of the current packet being sent
seq_total is set equal to the required number of packets

ACK: the type is set when the receipt is confirmed
seq_number is set to the number of the received packet
seq_total is set to the total number of received packets

If the server considers that the file is completed, then it sends the last ACK packet, and writes the calculated checksum to the data section
